Didn't really do a lot of stuff, was partying, few small files here.
Solved a few primitive problems on hackerrank, saved the ones i got trouble dealing with, last one showed me that i missed a lot, really, and should start almost from scratch. 
Well, it's not like i haven't been doing that most of the time. New update every tuesday.
