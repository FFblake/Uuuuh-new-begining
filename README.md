# Uuuuh-new-begining
So i was sitting at one point, realizing - i never took programming too seriously even though i am currently finishing third year of IT university (BSUIR). 

Teachers and professors usually give us tasks, although a lot of them, most take no longer than 1-2 days, even if you were sleeping through half the semester and have to spend time catching up. No more than 5 (out of 30+) asked us to add our projects to github or any platform, that could be later used as resume or portfolio.
Don't get me wrong, i did learn many things, well, mostly basics for them, like C, C++, a bit of ASM, low-level schematics, networks, Scala, SQL, Python and some more.

But although i can't exactly tell, i have a great "gut feeling" that my skills are Junior at best, and are closer to sub-Junior if that even exists.
SO i decided to spent most part of this summer to revise the skills i was had previously forgotten, create a few pet projects that could be considered small projects and not... a single big function for 200 lines. To get better at code writing, impement version control, blah blah etc., to sum up - to reach Junior level or get closer to it.

P.S. If anyone reads that in a few years, don't expect me to know all of the skills i mentiioned earlier - i am more likely to choose one of them (unless i went bananas, HAHAHAHAHAHA).
